## The Pinterest Voice

The Pinterest voice is our brand personality—it’s a part of everything we do. When writing at Pinterest, keep these guiding words in mind:

**Simplify ideas to make the complex clear**
Do the hard work to make ideas crisp and concise. Don’t make them think. Avoid fluff. Inform people, but keep your sentences short so they are easy to read. Long, complicated sentences often obscure their main ideas. Opt for short sentences and short words. 

**Keep it conversational so you don’t lose your reader**
We’re all just humans talking to humans, so read your work out loud. If it’s hard for you to read aloud, it’ll be hard for people to read. The moment when you stumble over the words is the moment your audience will stop reading them. Edit it again. Start over. Keeping things conversational helps you stay accessible, warm and friendly while also being direct.  

**Add a dash of cleverness to grab their attention**
Put your best stuff up top. Ask yourself: Would people stop what they’re doing to read this? Tell their friends “you gotta see this”? Every big initiative at Pinterest should have a short, clear description—it should be the first line we see or hear. When appropriate (and avoiding hyperbole) add a bit of wordplay, even a pun, alliteration, anaphora or another rhetorical device to help your writing stand out.

## Formatting
### Dates and abbreviations

### Links

**When adding links on Pinterest**
Links should be a part of a sentence, and it should be clear where you go or what happens once you click. 

In UI writing, if you have a one-sentence string with a link to follow, put it on a separate line:
We all love Story Pins
[See why](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home)

If this isn't possible, punctuate the one-sentence string to visually separate it from the link:
We all love Story Pins. [See why](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home)

In longform writing, make sure to punctuate when the link falls at the end of a sentence. Make sure the punctuation is not part of the hyperlinked phrase:
We all love Story Pins. If you still have questions, head over to our [Help Center](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home).

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
      - Keep links at the end of sentences, where possible
      - When linking a phrase, link the verb and the subject or else it looks complete (“[Call our help line](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home),” not “Call our [help line](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home)”)
      - Limit number of calls to action 
      - Make link text as self-evident as possible, so people know where the link will take them
      - If you’re spelling the URL out, shorten it as much as humanly possible, without sacrificing functionality
      - Links should be in bold with no period after, like this: Learn more
      - In blog posts where you’re shouting out a brand, don’t include the http://www—just start at the name of the site 
      - Examples: 
        - [Learn more](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home)
        - [See your secret boards](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home)
        - [bedbathandbeyond.com](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home)
        - Whenever you create new Pins, make sure to [use our best practices](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/home).

  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't" />
     - Don’t say Click here to do X (instead, just say Do X)
     - Examples:

**When creating URLs on Pinterest**
<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
      - Use common, short words that describe the page
      - Use one word (if you have to use multiple words, use a hyphen to separate them)
      - Start URLs with the website—skip the http://www.
      - Examples:
        - pinterest.com/gifts
        - pinterest.com/dolcegabbana
        - brand.pinterest.com
        - business.pinterest.com/en/how-pinterest-works
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't" />
     - Don’t use acronyms 
     - Don’t use numbers
     - Don’t make URLs case sensitive
     - Don’t include http:// or www. (like we said!)
     - Examples: 
        - pinterest.com/giftsanddelights
        - pinterest.com/dolceandgabbana
        - pinterest.com/tos
        - pinterest.com/155#92/99980
        - http://www.pinterest.com/terms

### Lists
Everyone loves a good list! Lists help break up text and make things scannable, so we’re totally into them. 

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
      - Use sentence case  
      - Use a parallel structure (start with all verbs or all nouns)
      - Use bullets whenever possible. Exception: If it’s a sequential list (like steps you have to take), use a numbered list
      - Capitalize the beginning of each bullet
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't" />
     - Don’t use punctuation. Exception: If at least one item in the list includes two sentences, use punctuation for all the items in the list
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

---

### Numbers
<br/>
**Numbers**
When you’re using numbers in tight spaces or places people are likely to scan, numerals can make your copy easier to read fast. Use numerals (1, 2, 15) unless it looks jarring written out (unless this looks jarring with the number “one”).
<br/>
- Abbreviate once you hit a thousand and round to the nearest hundred (except prices and percentages). Once you hit a million, round to the nearest hundred thousand. 
  - 1.5k Pins (1500-1549), 1.6k (1550-1599)
  - 2.8m (2,750,000-2,849,999)
<br/>
- Lowercase your increments, units and labels
  - 100x, not 100X (“Saves increased by 100x”)
  - 5m, not 5M (“5m recipes on Pinterest”) 
  - 5x increased engagement, not “5x Increased engagement”
<br/>
- Count a numeral in a UI heading as a capital letter when it kicks off a string, and treat the rest of the sentence’s title case thusly. For example:
  - 100 comments, not 100 Comments
  - 12 shoppable Pins, not 12 Shoppable Pins
<br/>
**Percentages**
  - Don’t use a comma until you hit 5 digits. (1230% vs. 12,300%)
  - (Nerd alert: [See how it plays out for each language](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VF6eScsgbC8RgvXZW3lwjKu3XEpGnqFaFR4FfCpUq_k/edit#gid=0).)
<br/>
**ZIP Code**
  - Always capitalize ZIP
  - Use 5-digit pattern (80538)
<br/>
**Decimals**
  - For values > 0, show one decimal place (5.2 is good)
  - For values < 0, show two decimal places so it looks precise, but not intimidating/overly long (5.25% is good)
  - For whole numbers, don't use a decimal (10 is good, 10.0 isn't necessary)
<br/>
**In longform writing**
- Limit how many numbers you include in a single paragraph or post so it’s easy for people to understand
- Always spell out numbers under 10 in longform writing (in UI writing, use the shortest possible writing—in this case, numerals—every time).
- When you’re sharing info about “steps” to do something, keep the steps between three and five. If there are fewer than three steps, think of another way to share that info—you don’t need steps to do it. If it’s more than five steps, try a format that’s more detailed, like a playbook.

### Timestamps
Timestamps should make sense when you scan them—no one should have to do lots of mental math to figure out when something happened. In small spaces (like messages) we can abbreviate. 

<TwoCol>
  <Group>
    <Do title="Do" />
      - Just now! up to 59 seconds
      - 1 minute/X minutes up to an hour
      - 1 hour/X hours up to a day 
      - 1 day/X days up to a week
      - 1 week/X weeks up to a month 
      - After a month, switch to a MM/DD/YY date
  </Group>
  <Group>
  <Dont title="Don't" />
     - 3 seconds
     - 96 minutes ago
     - 30 min
     - 36 weeks ago
  </Group>
</TwoCol>

**Using timestamps in small spaces...**
- Xm
- Xh
- Xd
- Xw
- After a month, switch to a MM/YY date
<br/>
**Using timestamps in Ads Manager (including graphs)...**
- Use the 24-hour clock structure
- 00:00 is midnight
- 23:59 is the last minute of the day
- Use PST/PDT throughout, not UTC

---

## Grammar and punctuation

### Capitalization
Sentence case is easy to read, and feels way more conversational (vs. title case, which feels very Grand and Self Important). It’s our go-to approach, with only a few exceptions.

**Use sentence case**
- Board name and section name placeholder text
- Business site and blog post headlines
- Buttons
- Error message titles
- Titles of talks at events 
- Form field titles
- Links
- Memo titles
- Menu items
- Microcopy and helper text
- Navigation 
- Page titles
- Placeholder text (gray instructional text within form fields)
- Sub-headlines
- Tabs/sections of Pinterest (following feed, more ideas tab, etc.)
<br/>
**Use title case**
- Brands: If you must refer to a brand, make sure to capitalize it (“Crock-Pot” rather than “crockpot”) and in the third person use “they” not “it”
- Holidays (you can always Google to double check tricky ones like Father’s Day or Back to School)
- Job titles
- Pin: Always capitalize—it’s a legal thing (see How to use Pin for more!)
- Pinner (Note: Use this sparingly, and ideally not at all. Instead, say “people” or “people on Pinterest”) 
- Proper nouns (World War II, Scarlett Johansson), acronyms (NFL, DIY)
- Topics in product UI/New User Activation (ex: Weddings, DIY, Naruto and Anime)
- Generation names (ex: Baby Boomers, Gen X)

---

### Contractions

Use contractions whenever possible to make your work conversational, in UI and blog posts. (“Isn’t” is just warmer than “is not;” always opt for “it’s” rather than “it is.”) 
- Don’t use old-timey or made-up sounding contractions like “shant” or “t’wouldn’t,” please.
- Don’t use double negatives like “I won’t bake no cake.”

---

### Hyphenation
According to the AP Style Guide/Purdue Writing Lab (our when-in-doubt go-to), you should
- Hyphenate a phrase when it’s acting like an adjective, coming before a noun 
- Don’t hyphenate an entire descriptive phrases 
- For a phrase you’re not sure of the hyphenation of...just Google it! Check if its most common usage is hyphenated.
- Use hyphens to connect a prefix to a phrase, when applicable (“pro-Obama”).

### Punctuation

Pinterest’s UI is clean, light and modern, which means using as little punctuation as possible. For tips about punctuation for longform writing, refer to the [AP Style Guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/journalism_and_journalistic_writing/ap_style.html).

| Punctuation              | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ampersand (&)        | Don’t use! Use a plus sign if you must.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Colon (:)            | Use to kick off a list, introduce an explanation or definition, or for editorial emphasis in longer form writing. <br/>Followed by a single space. Whether you capitalize the next letter depends on what your information is. DO capitalize if the next word is a proper noun, or you're writing an entire sentence after the colon. Do NOT capitalize if you're writing a fragment after the colon. <br/>Sometimes you’ll see a dot used in our UI like a colon in board headers—treat it the same way, and start with a capital letter! |
| Semi-colon (;)       | Don’t use—instead, rewrite the sentence or break it in two <br/>Use: Lili’s son couldn’t decide between a Superman and Spiderman party; Lili created a Pinterest board to consolidate ideas for the ultimate superhero birthday bash. <br/>Don’t use: When Lili’s son couldn’t decide between a Superman and Spiderman party, Lili created a Pinterest board to consolidate ideas for the ultimate superhero birthday bash.                                                                                                                |
| Comma (,)            | Don’t use the serial comma (boards, sections and Pins vs. boards, sections, and Pins)—see “Oxford comma” below<br/>Don’t use in stats, numbers under 100,000 or percentages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Ellipses (...)       | Don’t use in UI<br/>Exception: When we’re communicating that something's in progress / we’re preparing you to wait<br/>Finding ideas for you…<br/>But even better than ellipses = design delight/animation<br/>In longform writing, use ellipses to indicate zapped text ("like this quote from one of our Pinners, "Pinterest makes me feel like I'm in touch with ideas around the world...it makes me feel good."")<br/>No spaces on either side of ellipses (“Eliza...and Peggy,” not “Eliza … and Peggy”)                                |
| Em Dash (—)          | Use sparingly to denote a significant break in the sentence or parenthetical aside—don’t over do it, though<br/>No spaces!<br/>Use this to sign a name in an email. (—The Pinterest team)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| En Dash (–)          | Don’t use—use an em dash (—) instead!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Exclamation mark (!) | Use as you would in a real conversation: In sentences that sound like they have an exclamation when you say them out loud, or to introduce ideas that people will be genuinely excited about. <br/>Use sparingly! <br/>Use: Introducing secret boards! <br/>Use: We’re so glad to have you on Pinterest!<br/>Don’t use to add pep to inherently unexciting concept or when the tone is out of step with people’s emotions: <br/>Don’t use: Here’s how to change your password! <br/>Don’t use: You’ve been locked out of your account!         |
| Hyphen/dash (-)      | Hyphen/dash (-) - Use to show a range of numbers when space is tight (“10-20”) or spell it out in long form (“10 to 20”)<br/>To add a significant break in a sentence, use and em-dash instead<br/>See Hyphenation section                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Inclusive language

Using correct terminology to describe different groups is extremely important (and it comes up a lot in areas like marketing materials and internal communications). When in doubt or when looking for something more specific, email the D+I team; you can also refer to [A Progressive’s Style Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.sumofus.org/images/SUMOFUS_PROGRESSIVE-STYLEGUIDE.pdf) as a fantastic free resource.

**Specific terms for group identification...**
- Refer to a group as specifically as possible 
- Capitalize Black and White
- LGBTQ+
- Native American
- When discussing size: use “fat positivity” rather than “body positivity”
- With the exception of Millenials, the focus of much of our trend reporting, refer to ages by ranges and numbers rather than generations
- Latin (rather than LatinX or Latino/Latina)
- Genders: Man/men, woman/women, Non-binary, custom (“male/female” is about biological sex, not gender
- Don’t call an individual “diverse” (“This diverse Peruvian millennial”...ick!)
- When using the term “ethnic minorities,” consider if you’re referring to an international or US population. What is an “ethnic minority” isn’t the same in the US and worldwide! 

<br/>

**Tips on how to approach certain topics...**
- Make sure we never sound like we’re recommending or endorsing a diet
- When talking about gender, include multiple options beyond men/women 
- Consider that some nuance can be lost in translation, so follow up with your contact from the international team with questions
- Avoid using “the” in front of a group (“the young,” “the blacks,” “the lesbians,” etc.)
- Rather than referring to someone as able/disabled, refer to a person as “someone with ______”
- Avoid terms like “multicultural,” “diverse,” and “post-racial;” they tend to overpromise
- Make sure photos we choose represent people across genders, races, cultures, shapes and ages (that last one can get left out!)
- Avoid writing “weight loss success stories” when highlighting Pinner stories or advertising use cases. 
-  Instead, frame your story around fitness, health and overall wellness.
  - When writing about health, never use numbers to call out pounds/inches lost, clothing sizes, or calories burned (i.e. “lost 25 pounds,” “used to weigh 250 pounds,.” etc.)

## Legal language

Even when we’re talking in the fine print, we should still be straightforward and conversational.

**How to talk about privacy:** 
Use “private” or “privacy” for personal information issues only. Don’t refer to board settings or posts as “private”—say “secret” instead.

**How to talk about *Pinterest business***
“Pinterest Business” refers to our business marketing programs and channels. It is NOT a master brand for products or partnerships. For example, you’d say “Read the latest updates on the Pinterest Business blog” or “Visit the Pinterest Business page.” You wouldn’t say “Our latest products from Pinterest Business.” In that case, it’s just “Pinterest.” For more information about when to use “Pinterest Business” and when to use “Pinterest,” refer to our brand guidelines.  

**How to use *Pin***:
To protect our trademark for Pin, we have to be thoughtful in how we use the word “Pin” in all of our writing. Within the UI, consider if it might be better to use “Pin” or “idea” for clarity.

- **Write *Pin*:**
  - When someone’s familiar with the UI (lens, tried it…), and “Pin” most accurately describes the functionality
  - When someone is sending a Pin as a message (“Send a Pin to a friend” is clearer than “Send an idea to a friend”)
  - When giving technical advice to businesses (“Upload your Pin” > “Upload your idea”)
<br/>
- **Write *idea*:**
  - When someone is new to Pinterest or may be unfamiliar with what a Pin is (unauthorized page views, activation, many emails and notifications)
  - When explaining what Pinterest is (home feed, unauth, etc.)
<br/>
- **Use a mixture of both *Pin* and *idea*:**
  - When it would be redundant to have the word “idea” repeat multiple times throughout the same surface: Can you mix “idea” and “Pin,” or find ways to reword the copy and CTA so that you don’t need to use either?
